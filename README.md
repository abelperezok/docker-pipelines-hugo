# Pipelines Hugo

This repository has been forked from [this github repo](https://github.com/karelbemelmans/docker-pipelines-hugo) it uses currently Hugo version 0.40.3 

This is a Docker image that contains Hugo, the static website generator and the aws-cli Python scripts. I use this container to deploy my Hugo blog to AWS S3 using Atlassian Bitbucket Pipelines.

Check the original author's post [here](https://www.karelbemelmans.com/2016/10/deploying-a-hugo-website-to-amazon-s3-using-bitbucket-pipelines/) for more information about how to use this Docker image for your Pipelines setup.
